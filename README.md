# VHDL Bug: Incorrect Signal Initialization

This repository demonstrates a common error in VHDL code: incorrect initialization of internal signals.  The bug involves the use of an invalid default value, potentially leading to unpredictable behavior at the start of simulation or when the design is synthesized.

## Bug Description
The `internal_data` signal is initialized to `x"00"`, which is an uninitialized value in VHDL. This can lead to different results depending on the simulator and synthesis tool used, and may create unexpected behavior.  The correct approach is to initialize the signal to a known, defined value.

## Bug Solution
The solution demonstrates proper initialization of the internal signal using a defined value, ensuring predictable behavior.  In this example, it is initialized to all zeros: "00000000".
